%na Get rice to the party, need to show undecideable head on second tape will write on blnk symbol either 1. initial str. then equiv to single tape that never writes?



Basically show equivalence to some easier (mayb) universal TM, if not go down to NDFA, then abuse Chomsky 

Because every Turing-recognisable language is decidable, we know a language is decidable by a Turing machine iff some enumerator enumerates it. Furthermore, because a language is Turing-decidable iff.

For space bounds that are at least linear, the two-tape TM model is equivalent to the standard one-tape model. For sublinear space bounds, we use only the two-tape model.
