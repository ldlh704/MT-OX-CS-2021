Claim: A,bigous.
\\ Proof: 






Because the class of regular languages is closed under the unary Kleene Star operation, this means the class of regular expressions is also closed under kleene star, as every regular language is decided by a regular expression. Every regular expression is recognised by a GNFA, and because we can use the recursion CONVERT(G), in which each iteration has 1 fewer state (and is thus not at risk of an infinite loop between iterations), we know this 'new Kleene star' is merely concatenation of x, which not closed? in CFL but is closed in reg.
\\
$D$ is a nonregular unary language $D=\left\{ 1^{n^{2}}\  |\  n\geq 0\right\}  $, and $D$ contains substrings of the class of languages described by new kleene star. If pumping lemma choose  string between perfect squares, then violate because choose length p squared. 
\\
If A is a regular language, $A^{R}=\left\{ w^{R}\  |\  w\in A\right\}  $ is a regular language.

Consider the languages $L_1$, $L_2$. We will show $L_1$ and $L_2$ are neither CFLs, but $L_2$ satisfies the modification in the question. 
\\
$L_{1}:=\left\{ 1^{n}\  |\  n\  is\  a\  square\  number\right\}  $ 
$L_{1}:=\left\{ 1,\  1111,\  1^{9}\  ,\  1^{16}\  ,\  ...\right\}  $
\\
$$
$L_{2}:=\left\{ 1,\  101,\  101001\  ,\  1010010001\  ,\  ...\right\}  $
\\
Assume, for a contradiction, L is context-free. Theb

By our assumption, the pumping lemma for context-free languages will imply  for the string
